This is a training project, which is a Spring MVC - based web application. It's written in IntelliJ IDEA and uses Apache Tomcat 9.0 server, Maven building tools and MySQL database (H2 for tests).\
There is no any frontend part because my main goal was increasing my skills in building a multi-module and multi-layer Spring app (using REST) without Spring Boot and JPA(Hibernate) help. For requests/responses tests I'm using Postman's collection.
