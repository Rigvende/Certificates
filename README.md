This is training project, which is a Spring MVC - based web application. It's written in the IntelliJ IDEA and uses the Apache Tomcat 9.0 container and the MySQL database (H2 for tests).\
There is not frontend part because main goal is increasing my skills in building multi-module and multi-layer app (using REST) without Spring Boot and JPA(Hibernate) help.
